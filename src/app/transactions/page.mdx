# Transactions

Transactions are a core part of the Coba API — they represent the movement of funds between accounts, whether for internal transfers or external payouts. On this page, you’ll find everything you need to create and manage transactions programmatically. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## The transaction model

The transaction model contains all the information about a financial transfer initiated through the Coba API. 
It includes details such as the amount, usd_amount, account_number, account_holder, kind, description, created_at, status, token, provider_transaction_id.
Transactions can represent internal movements, outbound payments, or FX-converted transfers.

Each transaction is immutable once created, but its status will update as it moves through the processing lifecycle — from pending to completed, declined, or refunded. This model provides a complete snapshot of every transfer your application initiates.
