    'We’ll walk you through setting up your API client and making your first request — from authentication to creating accounts, checking FX rates, and initiating transactions. No guesswork, just straightforward steps to get you building fast.',
}

# Quickstart

To begin using the Coba API:

1. **Contact our team** to request your API credentials.
2. Use the provided `API Client Key` and `Access Token` to authenticate your requests.
3. Choose the appropriate API base URL depending on your environment:

```bash {{ title: 'Production API base URLs' }}
# Production
https://api.coba.ai/metal
```

```bash {{ title: 'Sandbox API base URLs' }}
# Sandbox
https://sandbox.api.coba.ai/metal
```

## Making your first API request

After picking your preferred client, you are ready to make your first call to the Coba API. Below, you can see how to send a GET request to the Conversations endpoint to get a list of all your conversations. In the cURL example, results are limited to ten conversations, the default page length for each client.

<CodeGroup tag="GET" label="/fx">

```bash {{ title: 'cURL' }}
curl -G https://sandbox.api.coba.ai/metal/fx\
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}" \
  -H "X-Coba-Metal-API-Key: {client_api_key}" \
```

</CodeGroup>

  </Button>
</div>

## What's next?

Great, you're now set up with an API client and have made your first request to the API. Here are a few links that might be handy as you venture further into the Protocol API:
