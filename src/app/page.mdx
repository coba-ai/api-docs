## Getting started {{ anchor: false }}

To begin using the Coba API, contact our team to request your API credentials. Once you've received your access keys, you can start integrating by making HTTP requests or using one of our client SDKs to access resources like account creation, FX rate lookups, and transaction initiation. {{ className: 'lead' }}

When your integration is ready, we’ll help guide you through going live — and support you every step of the way. {{ className: 'lead' }}
