# Foreign Exchange Rates

This endpoint allows you to retrieve the current foreign exchange (FX) rate between two currencies.  {{ className: 'lead' }}
By default, it returns the exchange rate from **MXN to USD**, but you can specify any supported currency pair. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## The Foreign Exchange model

The FX model represents the current exchange rate between two currencies.  
It allows you to retrieve real-time conversion rates—by default, from **MXN to USD**—but it supports any valid currency pair.

The response includes the base currency, the target currency, the exchange rate, and a timestamp indicating when the rate was retrieved.

This model is read-only and is designed for quick access to market rates for pricing, conversions, and transaction calculations.
