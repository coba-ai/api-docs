# Authentication

All requests to the Coba API must be authenticated using two credentials: {{ className: 'lead' }}
an <strong>API Client Key</strong> and an <strong>Access Token.</strong> {{ className: 'lead' }}

These two keys work together to securely identify your application and authorize access to protected resources. {{ className: 'lead' }}

In this guide, we’ll show you how to include both in your requests and walk through best practices for keeping your credentials secure.
OAuth2 is not required — Coba uses a streamlined token-based system designed for fast and safe integrations. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## How It Works

To authenticate with the Coba API, you must include two headers in **every** request:

- `Authorization`: This is where you pass your **Access Token**.
- `X-Coba-Metal-API-Key`: This is where you include your **API Client Key**.

These two credentials work together to validate and authorize your request.  
Both headers are **required** for all endpoints — missing either will result in a `401 Unauthorized` error.

```bash {{ title: 'Example request' }}
curl https://api.coba.ai/metal/fx\
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "X-Coba-Metal-API-Key: YOUR_API_CLIENT_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

Please don't commit your Coba credentials to GitHub!

Always keep them safe and if you suspect they have been compromised, contact support immediately.
